R package version 0.1.3.\n  https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gfer\n\n#### TIPS\n* Data collection part contains different reliable sources, e.g., Ministry of Environmental Protection, Ministry of Water Resource, etc.\n\n\n* Usually the functions will provide an option for you to choose whether you want to use a proxy to get the data, if nothing specified, your real ip will be used to scrape the data. You can also choose to use the free proxy provided by http://www.free-proxy-list.net/. Check Each function's description and find how to enable or disable the proxy.\n\n\n\n##### Installation\n* Released version, for beginners and normal users.\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\n  install.packages(\"gfer\")\n```\n\n* Development version, for experienced users and those who are interested in investigating.\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\n  install.packages('devtools')\n  # Ignore the warning that Rtool is not installed, unless you want other #function from devtools.\n  # If you have \"devtools\" installed already, you just need to run the following code.\n  devtools::install_github('Yuanchao-Xu/gfer')\n```\n\nDuring the installation of the development version, if there is some error, you can just follow the error message and reinstall the package with error. The most common message is\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\n  cannot remove previously installed XXX package.\n  or\n  error in installation of XXX package.\n```\nIf so, just use `install.pakcages('xxx')` to reinstall XXX package.
